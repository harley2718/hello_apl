# hello_apl

This repository is used by me (Hans Davidsson) when trying to
learn the basics of APL. I have earlier used other languages,
like Assembler (for Motorola 6800, Zilog Z80, ...), Pascal, C,
C++, Perl (version 4 and 5, Python (version 2 and 3), LISP.
Some of them has been used mostly for fun, but many of them
even professionally.

APL is a little bit different, but my current focus is to learn
the data types, including nested arrays, that was added to the
language after a few years.

The initial purposes of this repository are:

  1. To share my scripts to execute APL code that is
     stored UTF-8 coded files in GNU APL and/or Dyalog APL.
     
  2. To share my APL scripts that try to use a combination
     of data types, including the possibility to have
     nested levels of lists (vectors) or arrays.
     
I am using Ubuntu Linux 16.04 and I seem to have font
support for the characters used in APL programming.
I am using emacs with an APL mode to be able to choose
and insert non-ASCII part of the characters that are
typically used in APL.
